This repository presents #edai ongoing NLP research projects to empower endangered African Languages.

# 1- [OkwuGbé: End-to-End Speech Recognition for Fon and Igbo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07762)
Accepted at the AfricaNLP workshop of EACL 2021, OkwuGbé is a step towards building speech recognition systems for African low-resourced languages. Using Fon and Igbo as our case study, we conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis of each language and describe the creation of end-to-end, deep neural network-based speech recognition models for both languages.

The Fon and Igbo implementations are respectively [Fon-here](https://github.com/bonaventuredossou/fonasr) and [Igbo-here](https://github.com/chrisemezue/IgboASR). The full talk of the paper is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p42k7SmIAU

# 2- [Crowdsourced Phrase-Based Tokenization for Low-Resourced Neural Machine Translation: The Case of Fon Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08052)
Accepted at EACL 2021, WEB is a human-involved super-words tokenization strategy to create a better representative vocabulary for training. WEB is at the root of the first version of FFRTranslate. Read fully about [FFR: French-Fon Neural Machine Translation here](https://github.com/bonaventuredossou/ffr-v1/blob/master/README.md).
